# LegoBrick
Turn any image into a LEGO® brick blueprint

## Overview
LegoBrick takes an input image and analyzes it to determine the exact LEGO bricks you would need to recreate it. Whether you’re building pixel art, custom LEGO portraits, or creative designs, LegoBrick helps you translate any image into a brick-by-brick shopping list.

## Features
- **Image-to-Brick Conversion** – Upload any image, and get a breakdown of required LEGO bricks.
- **Color Matching** – Matches image pixels to the closest LEGO brick colors.
- **Brick Count Optimization** – Groups similar colors and sizes to minimize the number of pieces.
- **Customizable Output** – Choose brick size (1x1, 2x2, etc.) and resolution.
- **Downloadable Parts List** – Export a shopping list for your LEGO build.

## How it works
1- Upload an image.
2- The system processes the image, mapping each pixel to the nearest LEGO-compatible color.
3- The algorithm groups bricks by color and size for efficient building.
4- You get a complete list of required LEGO parts and quantities.
